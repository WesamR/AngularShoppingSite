I do not even know if you will check this code
, but making a website is hard, there is so much to do. I cannot even imagine how hard it is to make and manage and actual BIG website. But, I really like angular, it feels better to use than jQuery felt. (: I am pretty happy with this semester, I did better than I did in your gaming class last semester, and I feel like I am finally catching on (:
